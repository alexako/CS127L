POINTERS-DYNAMIC ARRAY- EXCEPTION HANDLING
=====

COMPUTE FOR MILES PER GALLON 
======

Make a program that will calculate and compute for the quotient of miles and gallons (mpg: miles per gallons). Your program should declare a constant array size of 10 for the following variable: miles ,gallons and mpg. Prompt the user to Initialize  the value of miles (value for miles should be 100-250) and gallons (values should be from 5-25). Use pointer galPtr for gallons, milPtr for miles and mpgPtr for mpg.  Use function MilesPerrGallon (double,double) to compute for the values of mpg and use exception handling try-throw-catch  to validate the values of miles and gallons.  Finally set the width to 7 and the decimal places to 2.


SORTING 
======

Using DYAMIC ARRAY allocation, a program that prompts the use to enter maximum  numbers to be sorted and output the numbers in ascending order.

***Note:
No modification should be done in the given codes (main function and function prototypes).
