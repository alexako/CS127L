**Log for Exercise 4**
 - Palindrome was easy. Iterated through string from the start and end while testing if equivalent.
 - Used pointer array to count letters of string
 - Typecast string char to char in order to use tolower()/toupper()
 - Problem with sleep() function. Not working at all.
 - password() and EnterPassword() are using curses.h. Need to use windows.h for lab.
 - iostream does not work with curses.h. Used printw() instead. Need to change back after testing.
