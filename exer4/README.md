Create a program that will first ask the user to enter a 5-digit password. Attempt to input the password should only up to 3 attempts only (use exceptions handling try-throw catch for method for validation), if 3 attempts are made the program should terminate. If password is correct, then your program will clear the screen and should display a menu like the following below:

[a] Check the palindrome
[b] Read in a line of text 
[c] Quit
   
For [a]: enter a word or group or words and determine wheter the word(s) are palindrome or not.

For [b]: enter a word or a group of words and determine the number of words, number of a-z (regardless of the capitalization), lowercase those uppercase letter and vice versa.
